# Bitmap-Control Task
Combine the keyboard interrupts and the bitmap display in order to control the movement of a four-by-four box on the display. Initially the four-by-four box will be in the top-left of the display (i.e. box-coordinate is row 0, column 0). The following keys will “move” the box:
‘d’ : move the box right by one pixel
‘a’ : move the box left by one pixel
‘w’ : move the box up by one pixel
‘s’ : move the box down by one pixel
